# Crypto Recovery Finder

## Project Overview
Crypto Recovery Finder is a web application designed to help users find and recover lost cryptocurrency assets. The app allows users to input a wallet address or transaction hash to scan for recoverable assets across multiple blockchains. 

## Installation
To run the Crypto Recovery Finder locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/crypto-recovery-finder.git
   cd crypto-recovery-finder
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**:
   You will need Node.js installed on your machine. Once you have Node.js, run:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Start the server**:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```
   This will start the Express server on `http://localhost:8000`. You can also use:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
   This will run the server with `nodemon`, which automatically restarts the server on file changes.

## Usage
1. Open your web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:8000`.
2. Enter a valid wallet address (Ethereum format) or transaction hash in the input field.
3. Click the "Scan" button to initiate the search for recoverable assets.
4. View the scanning results displayed in a table format, showing the asset name, amount, status, and an action button to recover the asset.

## Features
- **Responsive Design**: Built with Tailwind CSS for a modern, responsive user interface.
- **Wallet Connection**: The app includes a basic wallet connection feature (simulated) allowing users to connect their crypto wallets.
- **Asset Recovery Simulation**: The application simulates scanning and recovery actions for assets.

## Dependencies
The project uses the following dependencies:
- **Express**: A web framework for Node.js used to build the server.
- **Nodemon** (devDependency): A utility that monitors for changes in your source and automatically restarts your server.

You can find these in the `package.json` file:
```json
"dependencies": {
  "express": "^4.18.2"
},
"devDependencies": {
  "nodemon": "^3.0.2"
}
```
